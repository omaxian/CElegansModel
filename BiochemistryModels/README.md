# Modeling PAR-3 kinetics

This folder contains Matlab codes for the publication
"Oligomerization and positive feedback on membrane recruitment encode dynamically stable PAR-3 asymmetries in the C. elegans zygote," 
by C. Lang, O. Maxian, A. Anneken, and E. Munro, Aug. 2024.

There are two main files:
* PAR3SteadyStates.m - this will generate flux balance plots with the chosen parameters (as set up it will generate Fig. M3 in the math appendix)
* PAR3DynamicsAllSizes.m - this runs simulations of PAR-3 kinetics. Currently set up to generate Fig. 7E in the main text.
