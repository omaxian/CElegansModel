\section*{Introduction}
Cell polarity is essential for many aspects of organismal development and physiology, including stem cell dynamics, directional cell migration, and asymmetric cell division \citep{dewey2015cell, goldstein2007proteins, ierushalmi2021cytoskeletal, maitre2016asymmetric}. For most cells, the first step in polarization involves a symmetry-breaking response to a transient localized cue that creates asymmetric distributions of specific molecules or molecular activities. The mechanisms that underlie cellular symmetry-breaking have been extensively explored \citep{li2010symmetry}, but mechanisms that maintain polarity as a dynamically stable state with a fixed boundary position have only recently come under scrutiny \citep{sailer2015dynamic, gross2019guiding}.

On a large scale, a cell's polarity state is encoded by asymmetric distributions of protein molecules, which are shaped by smaller-scale processes like binding, diffusion, and active transport. In \emph{C. elegans}, polarity is encoded by the distribution of two distinct groups of (highly conserved) polarity proteins: anterior PARs (aPARs), which include the scaffold PAR-3, adaptor PAR-6, atypical kinase PKC-3, and GTPase CDC-42, and posterior PARs (pPARs), which include the RING-domain containing protein PAR-2 \citep{bland2023optimized}, kinase PAR-1, tumor suppressor LGL-1, and CDC-42 GAP CHIN-1 \citep{lang2017proteins}. 

Wild-type embryos polarize in two distinct phases termed ``establishment'' and ``maintenance'' \citep{cuenca2003polarization}. The mechanisms that underlie symmetry-breaking during polarity establishment have been well-studied \citep{cowan2007acto, munro2009cellular}.  Near the end of meiosis, PAR-3, PAR-6 and PKC-3 are uniformly distributed at the cortex, where they prevent cortical association of PAR-1, PAR-2 and LGL-1 \citep{schonegg2006cdc, others}.  One mode of symmetry-breaking involves the local inhibition of actomyosin contractility near the sperm MTOC, which triggers cortical flows that transport F-actin, myosin II, PAR-3/PAR-6/PKC-3, and other cortically associated factors towards the anterior pole, resulting in their mutual restriction to an anterior cap \citep{munro2004cortical, rodriguez2017apkc}. Posterior depletion of PAR-3/PAR-6/PKC-3 then allows PAR-1, PAR-2 and LGL-1 to associate with a complementary posterior domain.  Actomyosin contractility and cortical flow during polarity establishment require the small GTPase Rho-1 \citep{schonegg2006cdc, motegi2006sequential}, and in fact the sperm cue acts via Aurora A kinase (AIR-1) to locally inhibit Rho through the Rho GEF Ect-2 \citep{motegi2006sequential, tse2012rhoa, longhini2022aurora, kapoor2019centrosome}.  A second mode of symmetry-breaking has also been described in which sperm astral microtubules promote local association of Par-2 with the posterior cortex \citep{motegi2011microtubules}.

While the mechanisms that break symmetry are by now well understood, it remains unclear what \emph{stops} symmetry breaking. If the system is programmed to amplify an initial polarizing cue, what sets the limit of amplification? The by now standard mechanism is that anterior (CDC-42/PAR-3/PAR-6/PKC-3) and posterior proteins (PAR-1/PAR-2/LGL-1) form a bistable reaction diffusion system by competing for residence at the cortex/plasma membrane such that one or the other but not both win locally. Theoretical studies suggest that in principle such a mechanism could stabilize the AP boundary after establishment phase cortical flows cease, or in embryos that lack cortical actin or myosin \citep{mori2008wave, dawes20113, goehring2011polarization, lang2023oligomerization}. These mechanisms by themselves cannot, however, shift the boundary on realistic timescales \citep{lang2023oligomerization}, which is why flow is required.

In the presence of flow, it is still unknown what sets a limit to boundary progression. Recent work showed that, assuming an intrinsic self limit to contractility, the boundary can be pinned, with the position set by total amount of each PAR protein \citep{gross2019guiding, goehring2011polarization}. But the self-limiting nature of the flow remains a mystery. In wild type embryos, myosin accumulates at the anterior in a cap that takes up about 50\% of the embryo, and myosin flows from the posterior half of the embryo into the anterior cap. Despite the flow of myosin and the consequent A/P asymmetry in contractility, the cap maintains a fixed size (it does not contract), and the flow profile in the anterior is roughly zero \citep{sailer2015dynamic}. Moreover, ectopic accumulation of Myosin II during maintenance in PAR-2 mutants is associated with abnormal posterior-directed cortical flows and rapid redistribution of Par proteins \citep{munro2004cortical}, suggesting that the distribution of myosin, in addition to the PAR proteins, guides the steady state.

While we will show that the self-limiting nature of contractility applies in both establishment and maintenance phase, our focus in particular will be on maintenance, which requires CDC-42 to maintain asymmetries set up during establishment \citep{kay2001cdc, gotta2001cdc,aceto2006interaction, schonegg2006cdc, motegi2006sequential}. GFP-tagged CDC-42 becomes anteriorly enriched during polarity establishment, and studies with a GFP-tagged biosensor suggest that the active (GTP-bound) form of CDC-42 may be similarly enriched during maintenance phase \citep{kumfer2010cgef}.  Binding of CDC-42 to the conserved semi-Crib domain of PAR-6 is required for cortical association of PAR-6/PKC-3 during maintenance \citep{aceto2006interaction}, and PKC-3 is in an active state only when bound to CDC-42 \citep{sailer2015dynamic,lang2017proteins,rodriguez2017apkc}. CDC-42 also acts through MRCK-1, a C. elegans othologue of the mammalian Myotonia Dystrophy-related CDC-42-binding kinase MRCK, to promote asymmetric cortical recruitment of myosin II \citep{kumfer2010cgef}.  There is also evidence that CDC-42 promotes asymmetric enrichment of F-actin during maintenance phase (REF?), but the underlying mechanism remains poorly understood.  More generally, it remains unclear how these distinct outputs of CDC-42 are integrated to dynamically stabilize the AP boundary at a fixed axial position and limit contractility. 

In this study, we combine experiments and theoretical modeling to show that boundary progression can be stalled when distinct outputs of CDC-42 have different effects on contractility. By extending both establishment and maintenance phases, we show that the boundary position is in fact stable, regardless of the cell cycle phase. We then demonstrate, through experiments with a temperature sensitive ECT-2 gene \citep{zonies2010symmetry}, that the steady state observed at the end of maintenance phase can be reproduced even when establishment fails through a maintenance-phase rescue process, revealing that maintenance phase biochemistry encodes a dynamically stable attractive state. To understand how the PAR protein circuit (which involves CDC-42) interacts with myosin contractility to limit the extent of contractility, we introduce a continuum model. Without a self-limiting character to the flow, the boundary either contracts all the way to the end of the embryo, or slowly moves to the embryo interior over a timescale an order of magnitude longer than maintenance phase. To find the missing model component, we return to experiments, which demonstrate that branched actin in the anterior acts to reduce tension and prevent excessive contraction, similar to behavior observed previously in other systems \citep{muresan2022f, yang2012arp2}. Our model reveals that adding a threshold of CDC-42, above which branched actin is produced, is sufficient to reproduce the initial and latter stages of rescue, with the caveat that additional assumptions about branched actin are required to reproduce all experimental observations.


\section*{Results}

\subsection*{Establishment and maintenance phase contractility are governed by unique biochemical systems}

As a first step to examining the role of CDC-42 in regulating contractility, we sought to distinguish the phases of the cell cycle in terms of the upstream myosin regulator. We began by imaging wild-type embryos expressing non-muscle myosin II fused to GFP (NMY-II::GFP), as well as embryos expressing PAR-6::GFP. At pseudo-cleavage and prior to the onset of centration (Fig.\ 1A), myosin exhibited pulsatile dynamics, with large foci appearing and disappearing over time, and PAR-6 was enriched in clusters on the anterior cortex (Fig.\ 1B). By nuclear envelope breakdown, both myosin and PAR-6 had transitioned to diffuse, smaller clusters enriched on the anterior cortex (Fig.\ 1B). Pulsatile myosin activity during establishment phase has previously been shown to involve rho-mediated contractility \citep{michaux2018excitable, michaud2022versatile, yao2022modulating}, while the diffuse myosin clusters have been previously linked to CDC-42 \citep{motegi2006sequential}. Likewise, previous reports \citep{motegi2006sequential, rodriguez2017apkc} have shown that the diffuse PAR-6 clusters are correlated with binding to CDC-42, which activates PKC-3, while the punctate clusters of PAR-6 are associated with PAR-3. We therefore conclude that Rho-1 mediates contractility during polarity establishment phase, while CDC-42 controls both contractility and PAR polarity during maintenance phase. The coupling of biochemistry and contractility through CDC-42 makes maintenance unique relative to establishment.

To understand the markers of the transition from establishment to maintenance, we depleted embryos of PRI-1 via RNAi, which prevented DNA replication and stalled cells in late establishment phase (Fig.\ 1C). In particular, we found a typical delay time of about eight minutes from pronuclear meeting to centration onset, relative to wild type embryos (Fig.\ 1D). The delay in centration onset (left kymographs in Fig.\ 1C) also correlated with a delay in pseudo-cleavage relaxation (middle kymographs in Fig.\ 1C), and prolonged flows from the posterior into the psuedo-cleavage region (right kymographs in Fig.\ 1C). Regardless of the embryo treatment, we found a strong correlation between three events: centration onset, psuedo-cleavage relaxation, and the myosin transition from punctate to diffuse (Fig.\ 1D). These events consequently mark the transition from establishment to maintenance, and especially to the regime of CDC-42-mediated contractility. While this regime is our interest here, it is noteworthy that embryos in late establishment phase (especially PRI-1 depleted embryos) exhibit a stable A/P myosin asymmetry characterized by persistent anterior-directed flow, similar to previous observations for maintenance phase. We return to this point in the discussion.


\subsection*{The steady state of maintenance phase is a stable boundary with persistent anterior-directed flow}
A recent examination of polarity establishment linked the end of establishment phase with a vanishing flow profile and a stable A/P asymmetry coming from mutual exclusion of PAR proteins \citep{gross2019guiding}. Yet, embryos in late-maintenance phase exhibit a steady pattern of anterior-directed cortical flow with an asymmetric myosin profile \citep[Fig.~2]{sailer2015dynamic}. We consequently wondered which of the two pictures represents the true ``steady state'' of maintenance phase.  

To probe whether the previously-observed myosin intensity and patterns of flow in late maintenance phase are truly steady states, we extended maintenance phase by depleting wild-type embryos of the cell cycle regulator CDK-1. Marking maintenance phase as the period between pseudocleavage relaxation and anaphase onset, we obtained a window of roughly 8--10 minutes per cell, in which we characterized the myosin intensity and flow speeds. Later stages of the extended maintenance phase showed a relatively stable position of the myosin boundary (it in fact expands towards the posterior slightly) and a persistent anterior-directed flow which tends to achieve a maximum (magnitude) just posterior of the peak myosin location (Fig.\ 2A). However, because the myosin intensity and flow speeds in CDK-1 (RNAi) never resemble those of wild-type, it is clear that interfering with CDK-1 affects more than just the cell cycle, and it is impossible to say concretely that the specific flow and myosin profiles in late maintenance are ``steady.'' Nevertheless, we can conclude that an asymmetric myosin profile and persistent anterior-directed flow do not lead to further contraction of the boundary when maintenance is extended.

\subsection*{The maintenance phase steady state is unique and attractive in the presence of MRCK}
We next wanted to determine if the boundary position in maintenance phase is unique, or if it is a consequence of the dynamics of establishment. Previous studies in ect-2 mutants (which fail to establish polarity due to lack of rho activity) have reported a delayed symmetry breaking \citep{zonies2010symmetry, tse2012rhoa}, but have not directly explained this as a maintenance-phase phenomenon, nor studied how the boundary position and flow profile change relative to normal maintenance phase. 

To probe these dynamics further, we systematically imaged symmetry breaking in temperature-sensitive ect-2 mutants, marking the beginning of maintenance phase via the transition of myosin from large to small clusters (since there is no pseudocleavage), and the end of maintenance phase as the onset of embryo rotation prior to cytokinesis. As described in previous reports \citep{zonies2010symmetry}, embryos exhibited symmetry breaking that we refer to as ``maintenance phase rescue,'' since it occurs only when myosin is distributed in diffuse clusters. During rescue, myosin and anterior PAR proteins segregated into an anterior domain of the same size as in wild-type embryos. At the end of rescue, the pattern of flow was characterized by a stronger flow in the posterior half of the cell into a stall point at the edge of the anterior cap, as in wild type embryos (Fig.\ 2C). Embryos depleted of the kinase MRCK, which acts downstream of CDC-42 to activate myosin, failed to rescue polarity in maintenance phase, as neither the anterior domain nor myosin domain contracted towards the anterior (Fig.\ 2D).

Having characterized maintenance phase dynamics when establishment phase is either totally effective or totally ineffective, we wondered if having partial polarity establishment would lead to partial polarity rescue. To accomplish this, we depleted embryos of NOP-1, a protein which partially mediates contractility by activating rho \citep{tse2012rhoa}. Exposing embryos to varying degrees of NOP-1 (RNAi) led to varying boundary positions at the end of establishment phase. Upon the transition to maintenance phase, cortical flows were initiated, and the boundaries in each of the cells converged to the same approximate position at roughly 60\% embryo length (Fig.\ 2E). By contrast, in the absence of MRCK, the A/P boundary stayed in the same position throughout maintenance phase, and no cortical flows were initiated. We conclude that maintenance phase encodes an attractive steady state with a unique boundary position and flow pattern. When establishment is defective, CDC-42/MRCK-mediated cortical flows during maintenance phase rescue the correct boundary position.

\subsection*{Existing models cannot explain the dynamics of maintenance phase rescue }
We next explored whether a mathematical model, informed by existing knowledge of maintenance phase, could explain how maintenance phase tends to correct errors from establishment. We first considered whether the phenomenon of maintenance-phase rescue could be a consequence of an instability in the underlying myosin dynamics. Along this line, we performed linear stability analysis of a simple myosin model informed by our experimental data \citep{mayer2010anisotropies, bois2011pattern}. The stability analysis shows that the dynamics are unstable when the flow carries myosin molecules a distance larger than the hydrodynamic lengthscale, which is the typical length a local disturbance propagates through flows \citep{mayer2010anisotropies}. For realistic lifetimes on the order 5--20 s, the minimum flow speed to generate instability is about 40 $\mu$m/min, which is much faster than ever observed in maintenance phase. Thus the dynamics of maintenance phase rescue are not due to myosin instabilities.

Because the dynamics of myosin alone are insufficient to generate instability, PAR proteins must be essential for rescue to occur, as was previously shown in the case of PAR-2 \citep{zonies2010symmetry}. We consequently studied a model of maintenance phase biochemistry based on previously-characterized interactions (Fig.\ 3A), \citep{lang2017proteins}. On the anterior side, we introduced three distinct protein species: PAR-3, CDC-42, and PAR-6/PKC-3, while in the posterior we lumped all posterior PARs (PAR-2, PAR-1, and CHIN-1) into one species. A schematic diagram is given in Fig.\ 3A, and the equations which describe the circuit are given in the SI. In brief, PAR-3 is locally bistable because of oligomerization and positive feedback \cite{lang2023oligomerization}. The enriched zone of PAR-3 sets up a gradient of PAR-6/PKC-3, which inhibits all of the posterior PAR proteins. The posterior PARs then inhibit CDC-42 (directly through CHIN-1 and indirectly through PAR-2) \citep{munro2004cortical, sailer2015dynamic}. 

In the absence of contractility, our model predicts that the maintenance phase circuit has a unique boundary position, where the PAR-3 boundary sits at about 50\% embryo length (bottom right plot in Fig.\ 3B). Under normal circumstances, where the boundary begins at 50\% embryo length (the end of establishment phase), the boundary rapidly adjusts to its unique position in under ten minutes (top right panels in Fig.\ 3B). By contrast, under rescue conditions, which we simulated via a local loading of pPARs in the posterior-most 10\% of the embryo, the boundary slowly corrects, taking about an hour to reach steady state (left panels in Fig.\ 3B). The steady state here is reached through a wave-pinning mechanism \citep{mori2008wave, goehring2011polarization}, where the boundary stops moving when reaction and diffusion fluxes (both of which depend on the cytoplasmic protein concentration) come into balance. The change in protein concentration occurs through unbinding, which for most proteins occurs on the timescale of hundreds of seconds \citep{robin2014single}, thus explaining the slow dynamics. Our model therefore confirmed the experimental result that rescue is impossible without flows.

To model contractility, we made CDC-42 a promoter of myosin at the cortex, and cortical tension directly proportional to myosin (blue parts in Fig.\ 3A, see SI for equations). We set up flows in the direction of gradients in cortical tension, with all proteins on the cortex advected with the local cortical velocity \citep{illukkumbura2023design}. With contractility, simulations under rescue conditions reproduce the initial stages of rescue (Fig.\ 3C), where an initially peaked profile of pPARs invades the anterior domain, concentrating aPARs in the middle and thereby increasing the concentration of pPARs in the posterior. As a result of this, CDC-42 gets inhibited in the posterior, which gives a gradient of myosin from posterior to anterior. The gradient of myosin generates a flow which further compacts the anterior domain. The timescale of this compaction is much faster than without flows, and indeed occurs on a timescale of minutes and not hours.

\textbf{While this model reproduces the initial stages of the rescue process, adding contractility changes how the system responds to the enrichment of aPARs on the anterior. In particular, the reaction-diffusion mechanism that sets the boundary position in the absence of flow is no longer valid because enrichment of aPARs also enriches myosin. Thus, when the aPAR concentration increases, pPARs are driven off the membrane at a higher rate, but pPARs are also advected into the boundary at a higher rate. The additional advective flux of pPARs overwhelms the increasing reactive flux, resulting in an ever-contracting boundary with ever-increasing flows and pPARs becoming uniformly enriched (Fig.\ 3C). In order to properly reproduce rescue, the model suggests a need for a local inhibitor of contractility. If an additional agent can inhibit contractility without inhibiting other aPAR proteins, the reactive flux and advective flux would decouple, and the reaction-diffusion mechanism can stall the boundary. We return next to experiments to find such an inhibitor.}

\subsection*{Branched actin reduces contractility in the anterior cortex }
Previous studies in other systems \citep{yang2012arp2, muresan2022f} have suggested that branched actin networks could constrain myosin mini-filament motion, thereby inhibiting contractility. To see if this mechanism could also be at work in the \emph{C.\ elegans} zygote, we first compared F-actin organization in fixed, phalloidin-stained wild type and CDC-42-depleted embryos (Fig.\ 4A). In all embryos, a loose network of long filaments or filament bundles extended throughout the posterior cortex. Numerous bright puncta (hereon mini-comets) were enriched within the anterior cap, and a denser meshwork of filaments was also enriched within the anterior cap in a cortical layer superficial to the mini-comets.

Depletion of CDC-42 resulted in nearly complete loss of both mini-comets and the dense anterior meshwork, leaving a more uniform network of longer filaments/bundles (Fig.\ 4A) similar to that seen at the posterior cortex in the wild type. Thus, CDC-42 is required for localized assembly of a specific subset of filaments during maintenance. In other cell types, CDC-42 binds WASP family proteins to activate ARP2/3-dependent branched actin assembly \citep{pollitt2009wasp}. Consistent with this, depleting embryos of the essential ARP2/3 subunit ARX-2 caused a complete loss of both F-actin mini-comets and the dense anterior meshwork during maintenance, leaving the loose network of filaments similar to that seen at the posterior cortex in the wild type. Similarly, depleting embryos of the single C. elegans WASP homologue WSP-1 resulted in a severe reduction of the dense anterior mesh, although mini-comets remained highly enriched in the anterior cap (Fig.\ 4A). We conclude that CDC-42, acting through WASP, promotes the production of branched actin structures in the anterior.

To determine the effect of branched actin structures on contractility, we first returned to our model to see if there is a contractile asymmetry across the A/P boundary. Using velocity data from late maintenance phase in wild type embryos, we used a simple active fluid model \citep{mayer2010anisotropies} to extract a profile of stress, which we compared directly to the measured myosin intensity on the cortex (Fig.\ 4B). While there was perfect agreement between stress and myosin on the posterior, in the anterior there was a noticable mismatch, with the gradient in stress being smaller predicted from the myosin profile. The reduction in anterior stress, combined with localization of branched actin in the anterior, suggests that branched actin might be responsible for inhibiting contractility there. 

To test this hypothesis, we performed live imaging of myosin dynamics in embryos depleted of arx-2. Unlike in wild type embryos, which formed a stable cap that remained steady in maintenance phase, embryos depleted of arx-2 exhibited hypercontractility, with caps that tended to progress towards the anterior pole during maintenance phase (Fig.\ 4C). We tracked the myosin intensity during the three minutes prior to cytokinesis, finding a maximum intensity which progressively moved toward the anterior pole and grew over time (blue lines in Fig.\ 4D), in contrast to wild-type embryos, where the maximum myosin intensity retained a fixed position in the last three minutes of maintenance phase (red lines in Fig.\ 4D). Similar to the myosin intensity, we found the flow profile in arx-2 (RNAi) embryos did not display a stall point near the anterior cap, but instead exhibited persistent anterior-directed flows throughout the whole embryo length (Fig.\ 4D). We found a similar hyper-contractile phenotype in WASP (RNAi) embryos. By contrast, embryos depleted of both arx-2 and MRCK exhibited a phenotype normally associated with MRCK knockdown, where the anterior cap set up during establishment expanded slightly during maintenance \citep{sailer2015dynamic}.

Our observations of the flow profile in arx-2 (RNAi) embryos were somewhat confounded by their tendency to exhibit unstable rotation, leading to large bulk flows that were not aligned with the A/P direction. We hypothesized that these rotations could be caused by microtubule forces (from the mitotic spindle) pulling on the smaller anterior cap, which can no longer effectively resist them. Consistent with this, treating arx-2 (RNAi) embryos with nocodazole, a drug which depolymerizes microtubules, removed the large-scale rotations and led to more consistent measurements of flow. The resulting myosin intensities and flow profiles (Fig.\ 4D) were almost identical to those without nocodazole treatment, in that they exhibited a myosin peak which continuously shifted to the anterior, and a flow which was anterior-directed and on the order 2--4 $\mu$m/min across the whole embryo length.

The phenotype we observed in embryos depleted of branched actin was consistent with our previous model of maintenance phase without inhibition (Fig.\ 3C), in that the flow was persistently anterior directed and the myosin profiile consistently shifted towards the anterior. Indeed, repeating our previous experiment (Fig.\ 4B), in which we use the velocity profile during the last minute of maintenance phase to extract a stress and compare to the myosin profile \red{(which embryos)}, showed perfect agreement between myosin and stress across the entire embryo length in arx-2 (RNAi) embryos. Thus, in wild type embryos branched actin must act in the anterior to inhibit contractility.

\subsection*{The dynamics of rescue suggest an activation threshold for branched actin}
To further inform our model of branched actin, we looked at the dynamics of maintenance-phase rescue with and without branched actin. We first tested the effect of branched actin knockdown during maintenance phase rescue by depleting ect-2 (ts) embryos of arx-2 via RNAi. Unlike in normal rescue, where contraction of the anterior domain suddenly stalled, in embryos depleted of arx-2 the anterior domain appeared to contract at a constant rate until cytokinesis (Fig.\ 5A). The sudden stalling of the boundary in the presence of branched actin suggests a sudden production of branched actin on the anterior, which begins at a mid-point in the rescue process. 

To further probe this idea, we systematically imaged the myosin intensities and flow profiles during rescue, with the average profiles every 30 seconds of rescue shown in Fig.\ 5B. We observed two distinct phases of rescue: in the first phase, the myosin intensity slightly increased, and the peak shifted towards the anterior. Meanwhile, flow speeds increased, with the peak in flow also shifting towards the anterior. After around three minutes, we observed a sudden decrease in flow speeds so that the flow profile matched the typical profile from late maintenance phase in wild type embryos (black line in Fig.\ 5B), which then stalled the myosin boundary at a fixed point near the typical wild-type boundary. Plotting the maximum myosin intensity and flow speeds, as well as the position of the maxima, over time during rescue revealed the order of events in the sudden stalling (Fig. 5C). First, the flow speed suddenly decreased, which led to the stalling of the myosin boundary, and finally the stalling of the flow boundary. All of this occurred without significant changes in the myosin profile (in particular the maximum myosin intensity). Thus, if branched actin is activated in the anterior midway through rescue, its role is to inhibit flow speeds, and not directly inhibit myosin. This observation forms the basis of our model in the next section.

\subsection*{Incorporating branched actin into existing models correctly reproduces rescue dynamics}
We used our experimental observations about branched actin to reinform our model (Fig.\ 6A). Based on the sudden transition of the flow speed during maintenance phase rescue, we hypothesized that branched actin is produced above a threshold of CDC-42 concentration, where the threshold is necessarily between the typical posterior and anterior levels of CDC-42. We assumed that, once produced, branched actin directly inhibits cortical tension (but not myosin). Flows are still in the direction of tension gradients, but now the tension profile depends on both myosin \emph{and} branched actin (Fig.\ 6A).

Simulations that couple the model of branched actin with our previous model of PAR proteins and contractility (Fig.\ 3A) show stalled progression of the A/P boundary, with a final position that depends on the threshold of CDC-42 at which branched actin is produced (Fig.\ 6B). We quantified the threshold $C_R$ in terms of the steady state anterior level of CDC-42 without contractility, $C_A$ (Fig.\ 3B). When $C_R = C_A$, rescue proceeds as in the case without flows, but at $t=10$ mins a sudden decrease in flows stalls boundary progression around 25\% embryo length (top row of Fig.\ 6B; the bright dashed region in the CDC-42 kymographs is where the concentration is above the threshold). Decreasing the threshold to $C_R = 0.6C_A$ gives a similar phenomenon, but the boundary stalls sooner because CDC-42 crosses the threshold sooner (middle row of Fig.\ 6B). When the threshold is too small, rescue can never begin, because the CDC-42 concentration is (almost) everywhere above the threshold, causing branched actin to build up everywhere along the embryo length, thus inhibiting contractility everywhere (bottom row of Fig.\ 6B). 

These simulations demonstrate that our existing knowledge about maintenance phase biochemistry, plus the actin of branched action through an incoherent feed forward loop involving CDC-42 (Fig.\ 6A) are sufficient to explain the dynamics of maintenance phase rescue, in particular the ability of the embryo to rapidly correct errors from maintenance without catastrophic build-up of contractility. \textbf{In terms of reaction-diffusion dynamics, the role of branched actin is to decouple the build up of flows from the build up of anterior PARs. Once branched actin is active, the aPAR concentration (and reactive fluxes) can build up \emph{without} flow speeds (advective fluxes) building up. Consequent build up of the aPARs then stalls the boundary via previously-described reaction-diffusion mechanisms \citep{mori2008wave,goehring2011polarization}.}


\section*{Discussion}
%There is still a role for cytoplasmic depletion in pinning the boundary. Without cytoplasmic depletion, a boundary that is moving will always keep moving, since the fundamental balance in which pPARs outcompete the aPARs does not change unless we account for changes in the cytoplasmic depletion. What branched actin allows for is a change in how the flow speed depends on the myosin concentration in time. Initially, when there is no branched actin, flows are fast. But, when branched actin is created, the flows slow down and the boundary can no longer rapidly contract, allowing it to be stalled by cytoplasmic depletion. Thus, branched actin \emph{and} cytoplasmic depletion work together to stall the boundary at a point where the posterior PAR domain can no longer advance through the anterior PARs.

We note a distinction here between maintenance and establishment phase. In the latter, instabilities in the dynamics of rho combine with delayed negative feedback to yield pulsatile dynamics \citep{nishikawa2017controlling, michaux2018excitable, michaud2022versatile}. The connection between these pulsatile dynamics and the large-scale flows that establish polarity is still unknown.

Figure 6: Models that incorporate branched actin successfully reproduce the dynamics of rescue. (A) Extension of the model presented in Fig.\ 3(A) to account for branched actin. Above a threshold of CDC-42, branched actin is produced and inhibits contractile stress (left). At its simplest level, these dynamics are an incoherent feed-forward loop (right). (B) Simulations with varying branched actin thresholds show varying degrees of contractility. Shown are kymographs of the PAR-3 concentration, CDC-42 concentration (the brighter region outlined in black is where the concentration is above the threshold for branched actin production), pPAR concentration, and flow speeds (all with the same scale bar given at bottom right) over time. Each row shows a different threshold for branched actin, given in terms of the typical anterior CDC-42 concentration without flows (denoted by $C_A$). The threshold decreases from $C_A$ to $0.6C_A$ to $0.2C_A$ moving from top to bottom.
